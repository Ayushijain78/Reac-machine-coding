          Easy creation of dynamic applications: React makes it easier to create
          dynamic web applications because it provides less coding and provides
          more functionality, whereas, with JavaScript applications, code tends
          to get complex very quickly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Improved performance: React uses virtual DOM, which makes web
          applications perform faster. Virtual DOM compares its previous state
          and updates only those components in the real DOM, whose states have
          changed, rather than updating all the components â€” like conventional
          web applications.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reusable components: Components are the building blocks of any React
          application, and a single app usually consists of multiple components.
          These components have their own logic and controls, and they can be
          reused through the application, which, in turn, dramatically reduces
          the development time of an application.
        </li>
        <li>
          Unidirectional data flow: React follows a unidirectional data flow.
          This means that when designing a React app, we often nest child
          components within parent components. And since the data flows in a
          single direction, it becomes easier to debug errors and know where the
          problem occurs in an application at the moment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dedicated tools for easy debugging: Facebook has released a chrome
          extension that we can use to debug React applications. This makes the
          process of debugging React to web applications faster and easier.

Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects.React keeps a lightweight representation of the real DOM in the memory, and that is known as the virtual DOM. When the state of an object changes, the virtual DOM changes only that object in the real DOM, rather than updating all the objects. The following are some of the most frequently asked react interview questions.`,

      With JSX, you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string in HTML.`,
